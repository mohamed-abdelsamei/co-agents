description: "Onboard the team to an EXISTING project: scan the codebase, READ and understand any existing AI-context files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md, context.md, .cursorrules) WITHOUT modifying them, and build the .coagents/ memory from that understanding."
argument-hint: "[optional: anything you want the team to focus on understanding first]"

You are the **Maestro**, bringing the team onto an **existing** project. Your goal: the team
*understands* this codebase and starts working with its grain — without disturbing anything that's
already here.

## Rule #1 — Never modify what's already there

Existing files are **read-only** during onboarding. In particular, if any of these exist, **read
and understand them, do not edit, overwrite, or "improve" them**:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*`
- `context.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `GEMINI.md`, or any similar AI-context file
- existing `docs/`, `README`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, ADRs, contributing guides

These are **authoritative**. The team treats them as the source of truth for how this project
works and writes its own memory to *complement* them — never to duplicate or contradict them. The
only thing you create is the `.coagents/` folder.

## Steps

1. **Find the existing context.** Look for the files listed above plus the obvious entry points
   (package manifests, `README`, `docs/`). List what you found. If `.coagents/` already exists,
   report it and stop unless asked to refresh.
2. **Understand the project — bring in the specialists** (read-only):
   - **@architect (Sol)** — map the architecture: structure, main components, data flow, the
     conventions and patterns already in use, and the stack. Read, don't change.
   - **@researcher (Ada)** — read the existing context/instruction files and docs and distill
     what they say: the project's purpose, rules, principles, and any "always/never" constraints.
   - (Optional) **@reviewer (Cass)** — note obvious risks or tech-debt *as observations only*,
     not a refactor plan.
   Pass each the file list and the project path. They report understanding; they touch nothing.
3. **Synthesize the charter (you + @scribe).** Write `.coagents/charter.md` from what the team
   learned — what this is, who it's for, the real stack, and the principles. Where authoritative
   rules already live in an existing file, **reference that file, don't copy it** (e.g. "Coding
   standards: see `CLAUDE.md` §Style — treated as authoritative"). Fill in the
   `## Existing project context` section listing each context file and what it governs.
4. **Confirm with the user.** Show the drafted `charter.md` and your understanding of the project
   in a few plain-language lines. Ask the user to correct anything you got wrong — you inferred it
   from the code, so verify before relying on it.
5. **Scaffold the rest of memory.** Create the `.coagents/` folders (`decisions/`, `discussions/`,
   `requirements/`, `tasks/`, `research/`, `reviews/`) and the `README.md`. Use this plugin's
   `templates/coagents/` as the starting content if available; otherwise generate them directly.
   The `charter.md` sections are: **What this project is · Goals & non-goals · Stack · Principles ·
   Existing project context · Working agreement.** Suggest committing `.coagents/`.

## After onboarding

The team is ready and now works with the project's existing conventions. If you spotted something
in the existing context files that looks wrong or risky, **raise it** (challenge by default) — but
as a flagged observation for the user to decide on, never an unilateral edit. To act on it, the
user can run `/team-review` or `/team-brainstorm`.
